# Txtr

This project came out of a very casual suggestion of making an existing workflow accessible to busy organizers. The tools I used before were a text editor and a terminal, and a bash script that i would edit based on the circumstances: the bash script would loop over a space separated list, and have the passwords hardcoded in place.

To use this, just visit [my site](https://ankin.info/Txtr) or deploy to your own based on the [latest release](https://github.com/alexanderankin/Txtr/releases). None of the values get saved to your local machine.

This project was made possible with the volunteer labor of Democratic Socialists using [CRA](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (see `scripts` section of the `package.json`), consider sending [NNAF](https://abortionfunds.org/) your money, or donating a PR to your favorite FOSS project.
